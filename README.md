## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- JDK 21 (required for Gradle tasks and GitHub Actions)

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Setting Environment Variables for API Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the following environment variables:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTROLOGY_API_KEY=your_freeastrologyapi_api_key
HEALTH_API_KEY=your_health_api_key
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=your_google_calendar_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DROPBOX_API_KEY=your_dropbox_api_key
PORT=8000
```

## Pushing to a Hugging Face Space
Use the `push_to_hf.sh` script to mirror the repository to a Hugging Face Space. Add the following variables to `.env`:
```sh
GITHUB_REPO_URL=https://github.com/you.repo
HF_SPACE_URL=https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-user/your-space
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_hf_token
```
Run the script:
```sh
bash push_to_hf.sh
```

This will clone the GitHub repository, authenticate with Hugging Face, and push the latest commit to the specified space.

## Setting up Environment Variables

To set up environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (you can start by copying `.env.example`).
2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASTROLOGY_API_KEY=your_freeastrologyapi_api_key
HEALTH_API_KEY=your_health_api_key
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=your_google_calendar_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DROPBOX_API_KEY=your_dropbox_api_key
PORT=8000
```


1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t cimeika-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-fi
## Setting up JDK 21 and Ensuring Required Gradle Files are Present

To set up JDK 21 and ensure the required Gradle files are present, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required Gradle files in the repository.
2. Update the GitHub Actions workflow to include a `check-out` step before setting up JDK 21.
3. Add a step to ensure the required Gradle files are present in the repository.

### Importance of Required Gradle Files

It is important to have the required Gradle files in the repository to ensure the setup process completes successfully. The `setup-java` action attempts to cache Gradle files, and if no matching files are found, the setup process will fail.

## Adding GitHub Actions Workflow and Documentation

This PR includes the addition of the GitHub Actions workflow and documentation. The workflow automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the Cimeika project. The documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up the environment, running the project, and using the new features and functionalities.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/android.yml` file. It includes the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code**: Checks out the code from the repository.
2. **Set up JDK 21**: Sets up JDK 21 using the `actions/setup-java` action.
3. **Build with Gradle**: Builds the project using Gradle.
4. **Run Unit Tests**: Runs the unit tests using Gradle.
5. **Set up Environment Variables**: Sets up the environment variables for deployment.
6. **Deploy to Production**: Builds and runs the Docker container for the Cimeika application.

### Documentation

The documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up the environment, running the project, and using the new features and functionalities. It includes sections on setting up JDK 21, running the project using Docker, setting environment variables, and using the Ci assistant, event planning, mood tracking, child creativity, calendar management, and gallery integration features.

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/android.yml` workflow checks out the code, sets up JDK 21, builds with Gradle, runs tests, and deploys the Docker container.
