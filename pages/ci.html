                <li>Contextual Helper: Adapts to the section the user is in and provides tools that match the current context (e.g., helps add events in the "Calendar" section and organize images in the "Gallery").</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Example Interaction Scenario with "Ci":</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The user opens the site and clicks on the Ci logo, which immediately launches the chat-bot.</li>
                <li>The user asks: "What's new in the Event section?" Ci responds: "New events are being planned, such as the summer photo exhibition. Would you like to add it to the calendar?"</li>
                <li>The user chooses to add the event to their calendar.</li>
                <li>Then Ci offers to set a reminder a day before the event and the option to share it with friends through social media.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>Ci is an interactive assistant and functional element of the Cimeika project that helps users freely and conveniently navigate between different platform components. Its context menu adapts to each section, offering relevant features and real-time support.</p>
